The Student Management System (SMS) is a console-based application designed to manage student records efficiently. It provides essential functionalities such as enrolling new students, retrieving student details, displaying all records, and organizing data for better readability. This system is particularly useful for academic institutions or training centers to maintain structured student information.

**Application Flow:**
- The system starts with a main menu displaying the above options.
- The user selects an option by entering the corresponding number.
- The application executes the chosen functionality.
- The menu reappears until the user selects Exit.
